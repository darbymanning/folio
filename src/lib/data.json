Healthcare professionals use Infinity to manage their workload and coordinate care in and across multidisciplinary teams.

      "content": "<h2>UI</h2><p>My role at Infinity Health was meant to be soley as a software engineer. But given my design background and the requirements of the business, it didn't take long for me to get my teeth into redesigning the interface. The existing interface was lacking some refinement, and what started as incremental interface improvements led to a complete design rehaul.</p><p>Prior to joining Infinity Health I was working with at Kyan on the ITVX design system team. I took the learnings I had from this and built a design system for Infinity Health to use across the native app and web app. I was determined to work pragmatically and ensure the design system truly aided the team in being productive, without spending countless hours in Figma.</p><h2>Native App</h2><p>There was an existing native app which was already built in React Native. However there were a lot of technical debt, and the codebase was not scalable. Upon reviewing with the Head of Engineering we decided that it would be best to rewrite the app. We took this opportunity to take our time with the codebase, making choices that were well thought out and would make shipping new features and functionality more efficient.</p><p>I worked closely with the Head of Engineering and the product manager to ensure that all existing functionality was retained, whilst delivering new features in a newly designed interface.</p><p>Since myself and the Head of Engineering are both big Svelte advocates, we tried to make the codebase more reasonable than a traditional React Native app would be. We created a custom store using Zustand which gave us a really compelling solution to manage local state, replicating the functionality of Svelte stores with a similar API. Small wins like this meant moving between Svelte and React Native took less cognitive load.</p><h2>Web App</h2><p>Most recently I have been rebuilding the web app using Svelte and SvelteKit. This has been a more ambitious undertaking than the native app, as there is much more functionality and decisions to be made. As another greenfield project we again have an opportunity to work in a way that is more scalable, and deliver a more reactive and intuitive user experience.</p><p>I've been able to implement WebSockets to enable real-time communcation, which is imperative for a task management platform. We've also used OpenAPI for the API, and generated an API client which automatically builds a new release whenever the OpenAPI spec changes. This, twinned with a library called <a href=\"https://github.com/supermacro/neverthrow\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">neverthrow</a> enables us to work with the API in a functional way without any of the pitfalls of 'try catch' blocks.</p>"
